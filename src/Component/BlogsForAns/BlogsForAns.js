            <h1>Difference between authorization and authentication?</h1>
            <h5> <b>Answe:</b> Simply put, authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. The situation is like that of an airline that needs to determine which people can come on board.</h5><br />

            <h1>Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?</h1>
            <h5> <b>Answer:</b> Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.</h5><br />

            <h1> What other services does firebase provide other than authentication?</h1>
            <h5><b>Answer:</b> Many third-party service providers can help you in growing your business, by either providing specific services like Notifications by Twillio or by providing a vast range of services like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, which includes hosting, storage, authentication and what not.Firebase services which are dependent on Google Cloud Platform. So to understand the Firebase services, we have to know about the Firebase.</h5>
